## Tools
- [cisTopic](https://github.com/aertslab/cisTopic) - cisTopic is an R-package to simultaneously identify cell states and cis-regulatory topics from single cell epigenomics data.
- [Avocado](https://github.com/jmschrei/avocado) - About
Avocado is a multi-scale deep tensor factorization model that learns a latent representation of the human epigenome and enables imputation of epigenomic experiments that have not yet been performed.
- [Episcanpy](https://github.com/colomemaria/epiScanpy) - EpiScanpy is a toolkit to analyse single-cell open chromatin (scATAC-seq) and single-cell DNA methylation (for example scBS-seq) data.
