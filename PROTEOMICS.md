## Tool
- [pwiz](https://github.com/ProteoWizard/pwiz) - The ProteoWizard Library and Tools are a set of modular and extensible open-source, cross-platform tools and software libraries that facilitate proteomics data analysis.
- [alphafold](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold) - AlphaFold is an AI system developed by DeepMind that predicts a proteinâ€™s 3D structure from its amino acid sequence. It regularly achieves accuracy competitive with experiment.

# Datasets
- [PyPDB](https://github.com/williamgilpin/pypdb) - A Python 3 toolkit for performing searches with the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). 

## Visualization
- [Protael](http://sanshu.github.io/protaelweb/)
- [ProteinPaint](https://pecan.stjude.cloud/proteinpaint)
- [pViz](https://github.com/Genentech/pviz) - pViz.js: a dynamic JavaScript & SVG library for visualization of protein sequence features
- [Aquaria](http://aquaria.ws/Q9HD67/5i0i/A)
- [nightingale/protvista](https://ebi-webcomponents.github.io/nightingale/#/msa) - Nightingale is a library of re-usable data visualisation Web Components, which can be used to display protein sequence features (ProtVista), variants, interaction data, 3D structure, etc.
