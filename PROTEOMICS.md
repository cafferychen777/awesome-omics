## Tool
- [alphafold](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold) - AlphaFold is an AI system developed by DeepMind that predicts a proteinâ€™s 3D structure from its amino acid sequence. It regularly achieves accuracy competitive with experiment.
- [alphapept](https://github.com/MannLabs/alphapept) - A modular, python-based framework for mass spectrometry. Powered by nbdev.
- [matchms](https://github.com/matchms/matchms) - Python library for processing (tandem) mass spectrometry data and for computing spectral similarities.
- [pwiz](https://github.com/ProteoWizard/pwiz) - The ProteoWizard Library and Tools are a set of modular and extensible open-source, cross-platform tools and software libraries that facilitate proteomics data analysis.

# Datasets
- [PyPDB](https://github.com/williamgilpin/pypdb) - A Python 3 toolkit for performing searches with the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). 

## Visualization
- [Protael](http://sanshu.github.io/protaelweb/)
- [ProteinPaint](https://pecan.stjude.cloud/proteinpaint)
